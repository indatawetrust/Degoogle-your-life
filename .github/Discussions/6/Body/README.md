### New issue labels (August 12th 2021)

This project has been getting a lot of attention lately, and I decided to renovate it. Today, on 2021, August 12th, I have added **81** new issue labels related to the topics of Google and DeGoogling, and started a couple issues to demonstrate the usage of these new labels. I will add more another time, it took me over 30 minutes to create all these labels, issues, discussions, and updates today.
