### 50 new issue labels (August 13th 2021)

Today, I have added 50 new issue labels for some criteria that wasn't met, and also to include labels for every one of my DeGoogle article projects. There are now 140 issue labels total.

Here are the newer labels (you will need to zoom in to view them, it is a very long image file)

Note: new labels will still be added in the future, but I feel like I am caught up for now.
