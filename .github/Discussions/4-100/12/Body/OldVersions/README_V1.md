### My goal with issues and discussions on Degoogle Your Life

I did a big update to this projects social structure yesterday (2021, August 12th) adding 81 new issue labels to enable a new system of communication. Today (2021, August 13th) the label count is up to 140.

I haven't laid out my plans for doing this yet: I hope to make this not just a set of article projects, but a community that shares media and posts related to Google and the DeGoogle movement.

These issue labels will not only serve as a point of discussion, but they will help build the DeGoogle articles I currently have and produce, and share information about the DeGoogle movement.

I have now decided that the community will stay in both the issues and discussions sections in a semi fashion.
