### Why you should stop using "why you should stop using" in article names

This is a bit of a joke post, but it is also about a message on what should have been done differently.

A lot of the articles I started using the words `Why-you-should-stop-using` in their article name, and it gets repetitive. The articles are still of good quality and contain valid points and research, but the name may make people not want to read them. On newer articles, I avoided this, but it has already been done, and renaming them would break things.
