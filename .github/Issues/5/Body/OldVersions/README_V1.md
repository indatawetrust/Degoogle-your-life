### Notice: Google Bookmarks is shutting down on September 30th 2021

If you are/were a user of Google Bookmarks and are working on DeGoogling, Google has announced that their online bookmarks service is shutting down 2021 September 30th. It is yet another product to be [#killedbygoogle](https://killedbygoogle.com/)

Using your bookmarks will now require the usage of Chrome, which not everybody can or wants to do. For now (if you haven't already) you can export them and load them into another browser. This is another (small) but anti-competitive move by Google. (personally, I wasn't aware of its existence until I learnt that it was shutting down several weeks ago)
