### Alternatives to FitBit

In case you didn't already know, Google bought FitBit for US $2.1 billion dollars in November of 2019 in order to increase their data collection of health data. I need to mention this somewhere, and when it is fully announced, I am going to need to have some privacy respecting, open source alternatives ready. I am requesting alternatives to the FitBit service that:

1. Aren't owned by Google

2. Are free and open source

3. Are relevant enough to be used
