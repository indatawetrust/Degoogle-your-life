# [QUESTION] How to download your Google Sites data

I have a problem in my process of DeGoogling, which is that the "new" Google Sites won't download, but the "classic" Google Sites will upon going to takeout. I have tried numerous times in the past to download my websites using HTTrack, but it runs into problems, such as not downloading media, and downloading webpages that just redirect to the actual website, rather than the local copy.

Does anyone actually know how to rip the full site? Yes, I do have access, it is tied to my account. The main site has over 500 pages, and there is over 8 gigabytes of linked content. I also have multiple sites.
