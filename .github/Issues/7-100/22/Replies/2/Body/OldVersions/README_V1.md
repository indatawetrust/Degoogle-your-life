Thanks for the response.

True, but I'd imagine that if you turned off the internet while you installed Firefox, uninstalled Widevine and then re-enabled internet access it would most likely not phone home. I don't have the skills to test this though. I will, however, test whether Firefox can be installed with internet access disabled, when I get a chance (but that might be a while, since it would require me to first backup all my data and uninstall Firefox).

I'd have to test this also, but [Waterfox](https://www.waterfox.net/) used to not pre-install Widevine. I'm not sure whether that's still a thing in Waterfox G4 though. Also, they claim to support NPAPI (currently their NPAPI support is broken though), so that's a potential security risk (especially because people might have outdated NPAPI plugins left behind on their machine from back when everyone used NPAPI). On the other hand, both Flash and Silverlight support DRM, so NPAPI support is potentially a good thing if you're trying to avoid Widevine.
> I don't use Brave browser, but I have heard sources say something regarding DRM, I will fix this.

I used Brave Browser once, and it definitely doesn't (or at least didn't at the time) come with Widevine pre-installed. It should be noted though that Brave Browser is Chromium-based.
> Turning DRM off and disabling it doesn't prevent it from working

That confuses me. Do you mean that it doesn't prevent it phoning home or it doesn't prevent you watching DRM protected shows? If you mean the latter, which website did you test it on?

Kind regards,
