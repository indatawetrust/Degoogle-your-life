Sorry for the late response, I didn't see it until recently. Thank you for your input, it helps. I hope to improve the article at some point.

On your first claim, I can't find anything on that article regarding the EFF joining in 2014, can you please provide a source? I only know that they left in 2014, I never heard anything about them re-joining.

Second, I never said that WideVine can't be uninstalled. I noted that it would likely phone home if pre-installed, which is a privacy risk. Turning DRM off and disabling it doesn't prevent it from working. I have tested this on Linux/Ubuntu but not on Windows. I am a bit confused on this.

I don't use Brave browser, but I have heard sources say something regarding DRM, I will fix this.

For the YouTube portion, I need to clarify the types of DRM. Thank you for pointing this out.

Thank you for pointing out these errors. I will try to fix it by the end of the week, if else, I will get to it. You will be credited for helping out.
