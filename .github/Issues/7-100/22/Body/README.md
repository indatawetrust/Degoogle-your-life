Hi,
I just wanted to point out the following corrections to https://github.com/seanpm2001/Degoogle-your-life/wiki/WideVine. Obviously mistakes always happen, so I'm not criticising the article, just pointing out potential corrections.

Firstly, the "Violation of web standards" section refers to the EFF as a "founding member". Yet https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encrypted_Media_Extensions (paragraph 3) states that the EFF "joined in 2014 to participate in...decision making".

Secondly, the "what you can do to help" section is incorrect as a firefox user (on any OS) can uninstall Widevine by going to about:preferences, typing "drm" into the search box and turning "play drm controlled content" off (Widevine is the only DRM currently supported by Firefox). That will even notify users if a webpage (eg: Netflix) requires reinstalling widevine (note that disabling widevine in about:addons will not uninstall it). Also, Widevine is not installed by default in Brave Browser (on Windows, I'm not sure about other OSes).

A second mistake exists in "what you can do to help", since I'm not sure about paid YouTube movies, but free content on YouTube (which usually contains ads) does not use WideVine. (perhaps "free with ads" means something different, but the article does not make this clear enough to the reader)

Kind regards,
