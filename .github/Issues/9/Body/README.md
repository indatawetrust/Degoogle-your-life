### Does Google Swiffy need any mention?

Does Googles Swiffy service (discontinued before 2010) that converts Flash content to HTML5 content need a mention, as it hasn't been used/usable in years? If so, how should it be mentioned?

I am asking this, as I am curious as to if Google was still privacy invasive before their big controversy in 2010. I also want to be able to use the Swiffy label to get it out of my head.
